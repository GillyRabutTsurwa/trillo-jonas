## Version 1 Notes 

* SVGs only appear on web servers - So that's why that happens
* Editting SVGs. 
  * Give them a height and width
  * Change their colour with the fill property
* I am already quite comfortable with flexbox. But this lecture m'a beaucoup aid√©
* flex short hand property = flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis
  * Example flex: 0 0 40% = don't grow if you have the chance, don't shrink if the window get smaller, and set the width of the element to 40%........ which will SHRINK the element for responsiveness.
* Nested flexing can get kind of crazy
